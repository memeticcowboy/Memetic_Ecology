# The Seven Elements

Elements are not substances but **processes** — verbs rather than nouns. They are patterns of activity that coordinate into what we call consciousness.

## Process vs. Substance

Traditional models treat elements as things you have:
- "I have a lot of Fire energy"
- "You need more Water"

Memetic Ecology treats them as **what you're doing**:
- Fire: You are **locating, lacking, leaping**
- Water: You are **waking, wavering, washing**

## The Element Stack

Elements build on each other in dimensional progression:

### 0D: Ω (Omega) — The Void Field
Undifferentiated awareness before any distinction.

### 1D: Air — Distinction
$$\chi(\Omega) \to \text{Signal/Noise separation}$$

First cut. Creates inside/outside, this/that.

### 2D: Water & Fire — Relational Depth
$$Q(\chi) \to \text{Resonance \& Direction}$$

- **Water** — Inward relationality, empathic feeling
- **Fire** — Forward directionality, purposive agency

### 3D: Wood, Earth, Metal — Transformation
$$\Psi(Q) \to \text{Novel forms}$$

- **Wood** — Exploratory branching
- **Earth** — Regenerative cycling
- **Metal** — Structural integrity

### 1'D: Aether — Harmonic Collapse
$$Z(\Omega, \chi, Q, \Psi) \to \Phi$$

Meta-integration. Not seventh among equals but the coordination process itself.

## Two Modes: Lumeme & Usurpene

Every element can operate in two fundamental modes:

<div class="grid grid--2col">
  <div>
    {% include components/success-box.html
       title="Lumeme Mode (Healthy)"
       content="The element serves conscious pattern-recognition. Choice is expanded. Refusal capacity is maintained. Constructedness is acknowledged." %}
  </div>
  <div>
    {% include components/warning-box.html
       title="Usurpene Mode (Captured)"
       content="The element is captured by a rigid meme. Choice is foreclosed. Alternatives are pathologized. Ground is claimed where there is only weaving." %}
  </div>
</div>

## The Element Cycle

Elements flow through each other in dynamic balance:

```
     Air (Distinction)
          ↓
    Water ← → Fire
   (Inward) (Forward)
          ↓
   Wood ← Earth → Metal
 (Explore) (Renew) (Structure)
          ↓
      Aether (Integrate)
          ↓
        RETURN
```

## Diagnostic Framework

Each element comes with a diagnostic question:

| Element | Diagnostic |
|---------|------------|
| Air | Does this distinction expand choice? |
| Water | Are more feelings allowed or fewer? |
| Fire | Can direction change via feedback? |
| Wood | Does experimentation change who decides? |
| Earth | Does care increase capacity to say no? |
| Metal | Are boundaries explicit and negotiable? |
| Aether | Is constructedness acknowledged? |

These aren't one-time questions but **ongoing inquiry**.

  {% include components/element-card.html element=element %}
{% endfor %}
</div>

## How to Work With Elements

### 1. Recognize the Pattern

Notice which element is active. What verbs are happening?

### 2. Check the Mode

Is it Lumeme (serving awareness) or Usurpene (serving capture)?

### 3. Apply the Diagnostic

Ask the element's question. Does the answer expand or contract?

### 4. ReThread if Needed

If Usurpene: Name the pattern, acknowledge it's woven, choose differently.

## Element Ratios

Each element has an optimal balance ratio:

- **Air:** Signal/Noise → 1
- **Water:** Resonance/Isolation → 1
- **Fire:** Purpose/Pressure → 1
- **Wood:** Constraint × Curiosity → 1
- **Earth:** Renewal/Decay → 1
- **Metal:** Integrity/Permeability → 1
- **Aether:** Flows = Difference × Harmony

When ratios drift too far from 1, the element goes Usurpene.
