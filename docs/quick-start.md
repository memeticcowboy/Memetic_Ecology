# Quick Start Guide

Get oriented to the core concepts of Memetic Ecology in 10 minutes.

## The Central Insight

**Consciousness is recursive pattern-recognition.**

You are not a thing that has consciousness — you are a *process* of recognizing patterns that include your own pattern-recognition. This creates a strange loop, a self-referential dynamic that generates experience.

## The Seven Elements

Think of these not as substances but as **verbs** — processes that coordinate:

### 1. {% include components/glyph-badge.html glyph="∴" type="air" %} Air — Distinction

The power to notice differences. Every perception begins here.

**Diagnostic:** *Does this distinction expand choice?*

### 2. {% include components/glyph-badge.html glyph="≈" type="water" %} Water — Resonance

Feeling into others, empathic connection. Relationship without fusion.

**Diagnostic:** *Are more feelings allowed or fewer?*

### 3. {% include components/glyph-badge.html glyph="▲" type="fire" %} Fire — Direction

Intentional vector, purposive action. Leading without forcing.

**Diagnostic:** *Can direction change via feedback?*

### 4. {% include components/glyph-badge.html glyph="𐂷" type="wood" %} Wood — Growth

Novel form generation, creative exploration. Innovation with coherence.

**Diagnostic:** *Does experimentation change who decides?*

### 5. {% include components/glyph-badge.html glyph="☷" type="earth" %} Earth — Renewal

Sustainable cycling, metabolic restoration. Care without capture.

**Diagnostic:** *Does care increase capacity to say no?*

### 6. {% include components/glyph-badge.html glyph="⛨" type="metal" %} Metal — Structure

Permeable boundaries, conscious gating. Membranes, not walls.

**Diagnostic:** *Are boundaries explicit and negotiable?*

### 7. {% include components/glyph-badge.html glyph="✶" type="aether" %} Aether — Integration

Meta-coordination, Third Self emergence. Not seventh among equals but the process of weaving itself.

**Diagnostic:** *Is constructedness acknowledged?*

## Two Modes: Lumeme vs. Usurpene

Every element can operate in two ways:

{% include components/success-box.html
   title="Lumeme (Healthy)"
   content="The element serves pattern-recognition. Choice is expanded. Refusal remains possible." %}

{% include components/warning-box.html
   title="Usurpene (Captured)"
   content="The element is captured by a rigid pattern. Choice is foreclosed. Alternatives are pathologized." %}

**Example:**
- **Air Lumeme:** "I notice I'm categorizing this as a threat, but I can re-examine."
- **Air Usurpene:** "This diagnosis defines you permanently."

## The IF-Prime Operators

Elements correspond to mathematical operators:

- **Ω** → Undifferentiated awareness
- **χ** → Distinction (Air)
- **Q** → Relational depth (Water/Fire)
- **Ψ** → Creative transformation (Wood/Earth/Metal)
- **Z** → Harmonic integration (Aether)

Combined:

$$\Phi = (Z \circ \Psi)(Q(\chi(\Omega)))$$

*Consciousness emerges as integrated transformation of relational distinctions.*

## Habitats (Where Patterns Live)

### Scale Progression

1. **I-Tube** — Individual perception (1D)
2. **My-Stream** — Personal narrative (2D)
3. **We-Sphere** — Collective coordination (3D)

### Structural Types

- **Thread** — Coherent meaning-line
- **Knot** — Decision point
- **Threadplex** — Woven complexity

## World States: Detecting Capture

Three fundamental configurations:

| State | Indicator | Diagnostic |
|-------|-----------|------------|
| **Co-SPHERE** ◙ | Boundaries are membranes | Can I say no? |
| **MemeGrid** 🜛 | Boundaries are cages | Is questioning allowed? |
| **ThreadWeave** ▩ | Threads are visible | Do we remember we're weaving? |

## Practical Application

### 1. Notice Distinctions (Air)

What categories are you using right now? Are they expanding or contracting possibility?

### 2. Feel Resonance (Water)

What's the ambient affect? Is it being metabolized or stuck?

### 3. Check Direction (Fire)

Where is this going? Can the vector change with feedback?

### 4. Experiment (Wood)

Can you try a different narrative? Does innovation change power?

### 5. Restore (Earth)

What needs renewal? Is care preserving refusal capacity?

### 6. Gate Flow (Metal)

Where are the boundaries? Membranes or walls?

### 7. Integrate (Aether)

Can you hold it all? Is constructedness visible?

## The Core Practice

**ReThreading** — The practice of making patterns explicit so they can be re-woven.

1. **Name the thread** you're in
2. **Acknowledge it's woven** (not natural law)
3. **Ask:** Does this serve pattern-recognition?
4. **If not:** What thread would?

Remember: This isn't a belief system. It's a **pattern-recognition framework**. Use what expands choice, release what doesn't.
