# World-States — Z-Behavior Regimes

World-states describe **how coordination behaves across the entire habitat stack**.

They are not goals.
They are not ideals.
They are not destinations.

They are descriptive topologies.

## 🜛 Co-SPHERE — Ω-Permeable Coordination

(Z ∘ Ψ ∘ Q ∘ χ)(Ω) ⊕ Ω

- Soft global minimum
- Coordination without closure
- Norms remain revisable
- Belonging remains optional
- Worlds know they are worlds

---

## ▩ MemeGrid — Ω-Excluded Coordination

(Z ∘ Ψ ∘ Q ∘ χ)(Ω) with Ω excluded

- Hard global minimum
- Mandatory descent
- Control lattice
- Escalating exit costs
- Repetition replaces sense-making

---

## The Core Bifurcation

There is exactly one system-level question:

> **Does Z remain Ω-permeable?**

- Yes → Co-SPHERE remains possible
- No → MemeGrid pressure propagates everywhere

---

## One-Line Diagnostic Lock

If Ω can still re-enter anywhere in the stack, a Co-SPHERE remains possible.  
If Z seals Ω anywhere, MemeGrid pressure propagates everywhere.

---

## Final Invariant

World-states are descriptions, not prescriptions.

They never justify intervention.
They never authorize control.
They only reveal topology.
