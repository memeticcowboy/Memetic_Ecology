# Habitats — Diagnostic Circulation Contexts

Habitats are **ecological contexts** where Φ(t) becomes observable.

They do not generate Φ(t).
They do not decide outcomes.
They do not authorize action.

They are diagnostic only.

## 1. It-Field (ᖺ) — Pre-Habitat Zero Point

**Regime presence:** Ω only  
**World-state relevance:** None

**Diagnostic:**  
If Ω is named, owned, moralized, or claimed → you are no longer here.

---

## 2. I-Tube (◎) — Perceptual Interface

**Dominant regimes:** χ(Ω)

🜛 Co-SPHERE  
- Distinctions remain provisional

▩ MemeGrid  
- Filter capture
- Distinction treated as truth or identity

**Diagnostic:**  
Can this distinction be un-cut without collapse?

---

## 3. My-Stream (⤸·⤹) — Temporal–Affective Flow

**Dominant regimes:** (Q ∘ χ)(Ω)

🜛 Co-SPHERE  
- Affect metabolizes
- Narrative remains flexible

▩ MemeGrid  
- Affective loops
- Emotion weaponized for stability

**Diagnostic:**  
Does feeling expand optionality—or narrow it?

---

## 4. We-Sphere (◯) — Relational Flow

**Dominant regimes:** (Q ∘ χ)(Ω) across multiple I-Tubes

🜛 Co-SPHERE  
- Belonging optional
- Dissent metabolized

▩ MemeGrid  
- Compliance pressure
- Escalating exit costs

**Diagnostic:**  
Can one remain while disagreeing—or leave without punishment?

---

## 5. Thread (∿) — Gradient Path

**Dominant regimes:** (Ψₑₓₚₗₒᵣatory ∘ Q ∘ χ)(Ω)

🜛 Co-SPHERE  
- Gradients fork
- New paths appear

▩ MemeGrid  
- Single approved descent

**Diagnostic:**  
Are multiple sense-making paths still imaginable?

---

## 6. Knot (╬) — Local Coherence Minimum

**Dominant regimes:** (Ψ ∘ Q ∘ χ)(Ω)

🜛 Co-SPHERE  
- Knots revisable
- Identity = compression

▩ MemeGrid  
- Over-binding
- Identity lock-in

**Diagnostic:**  
Can this knot loosen without existential threat?

---

## 7. Threadplex (∿╬∿) — Gradient Field

**Dominant regimes:** (Ψₜₒₜₐₗ ∘ Q ∘ χ)(Ω)

🜛 Co-SPHERE  
- Re-threading under stress

▩ MemeGrid  
- Flattened gradients
- Re-threading impossible

**Diagnostic:**  
Does dissonance reroute flow—or trigger enforcement?

---

## 8. Lattice (⿻) — Structural Memory Scaffold

**Role:**  
Records outcomes of Ψ and Z  
Biases future paths without commanding content

🜛 Co-SPHERE  
- Structure supports memory without dictation

▩ MemeGrid  
- History becomes law
- Structure replaces sense

**Diagnostic:**  
Does the structure remember *how*—or command *what*?
