# Φ(t) — Core Equation and Reframe

This document defines **Φ(t)** as a **habitat-agnostic, world-state-sensitive formal invariant**.

Φ(t) does not act.
Φ(t) does not decide.
Φ(t) does not optimize.

It names a **necessary condition** for meaning to remain mobile under coordination.

## Symbolic Form (Reference Only)

Φ(t) = (Z ∘ Ψ ∘ Q ∘ χ)(Ω) ⊕ₕₐᵣₘₒₙᵢ𝚌 Ω

This expression is symbolic shorthand.

- Not a pipeline
- Not a process
- Not a causal mechanism

It exists to name a **structural constraint**, not to be run.

---

## Key Reframe (Non-Negotiable)

- **Φ(t) does not belong to a habitat**
- **Φ(t) passes through habitats**
- **Habitats are where Φ(t) is expressed, constrained, or amplified**

World-states are **not additional layers**.
They are **Z-behavior regimes applied across all habitats simultaneously**.

Nothing new is added.
Nothing is duplicated.
Nothing competes.

## Regimes (Transformational Modes)

Regimes describe **how meaning transforms**, not where it lives.

| Regime | Name | Role |
|------|------|------|
| Ω | Undifferentiated Field | Reseeding difference |
| χ | Distinction | Perceptual cut |
| Q | Flow | Temporal–relational carry |
| Ψ | Binding | Stabilization & compression |
| Z | Coordination | World-level alignment |

**Rule:** Regimes are never agents, places, or authorities.

## The Harmonic Condition

The ⊕ₕₐᵣₘₒₙᵢ𝚌 Ω term names a non-negotiable condition:

> **Z must remain Ω-permeable**

This is not ethical.
It is structural.

When Z seals Ω, coordination collapses into a hard global minimum.

---

## Category Integrity Lock

- Regimes → how meaning transforms
- Habitats → where meaning circulates
- World-States → global coordination topology

Any collapse between these categories constitutes category error.
