# Memetic Ecology Documentation

Welcome to the comprehensive documentation for Memetic Ecology — a framework for understanding consciousness as recursive pattern-recognition.

## What is Memetic Ecology?

Memetic Ecology treats consciousness not as substance but as **process** — specifically, as the recursive recognition of patterns. Just as ecological systems maintain themselves through dynamic balance rather than static structure, conscious experience emerges from the interplay of seven elemental processes.

## Core Framework

The framework consists of three interconnected layers:

### 1. Elements (Process Layer)

Seven fundamental processes that coordinate into conscious experience:

<div class="grid grid--3col">
{% for element in site.data.elements %}
  {% include components/element-card.html element=element %}
{% endfor %}
</div>

### 2. Operators (Mathematical Layer)

IF-Prime operators that formalize element dynamics:

- **Ω (Omega)** — Undifferentiated awareness
- **χ (Chi)** — Distinction-making
- **Q** — Relational depth (inward/forward)
- **Ψ (Psi)** — Creative transformation (exploratory/regenerative/structural)
- **Z** — Harmonic integration

### 3. Habitats (Structural Layer)

Coordination spaces where patterns live:

- **I-Tube** — Individual perception
- **My-Stream** — Personal narrative
- **We-Sphere** — Collective coordination
- **Thread** — Coherent meaning-line
- **Knot** — Decision point
- **Threadplex** — Complex adaptive network

## Key Equations

### The Master Equation

$$\Phi(t) = (Z \circ \Psi)(Q(\chi(\Omega)))$$

Consciousness (Φ) emerges as the harmonic collapse (Z) of transformative operations (Ψ) on relational distinctions (Q) made from undifferentiated awareness (Ω).

### Flow Equation

$$\text{Flows} = \text{Difference} \times \text{Harmony}$$

Productive change requires both differentiation and integration.

## World States

The framework distinguishes three fundamental world configurations:

{% include components/success-box.html
   title="Co-SPHERE (Permeable)"
   content="Boundaries are explicit and negotiable. Refusal capacity is maintained. Questions are welcomed." %}

{% include components/warning-box.html
   title="MemeGrid (Sealed)"
   content="Alternatives are foreclosed. Ideology masquerades as ground. Questioning is pathologized." %}

  <p class="callout__content">Constructedness is acknowledged. Multiple narratives coexist. Weaving is visible as weaving.</p>
</div>

## Getting Started

1. **[Quick Start Guide](/docs/quick-start/)** — Fast orientation to core concepts
2. **[Elements Overview](/docs/elements/)** — Deep dive into the seven processes
3. **[SIML Language](/docs/siml/)** — Learn the notation system
4. **[Reference](/docs/reference/glossary/)** — Comprehensive glossary and equations

## Diagnostic Orientation

Each concept includes a diagnostic question to help you apply it:

{% include components/diagnostic.html
   question="What patterns am I recognizing right now?"
   context="Meta-awareness check" %}

These questions aren't meant to be answered once but held as ongoing inquiry.

## Navigation

Use the sidebar to explore specific topics, or start with:

- Understanding [Air (Distinction)](/docs/elements/air/) as your perceptual interface
- Learning how [Operators](/docs/operators/) formalize element dynamics
- Exploring [Habitats](/docs/habitats/) as coordination structures
- Reading about [World States](/docs/habitats/world-states/) to recognize sealed vs. permeable configurations

*The framework is designed to be fractal — each concept contains the whole, and depth reveals similarity at every scale.*
