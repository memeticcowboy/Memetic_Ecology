Welcome to the Memetic Ecology documentation site. This framework represents years of exploration into the nature of consciousness, pattern-recognition, and the dynamics of meaning-making.

## What You'll Find Here

This site contains:

- **Comprehensive documentation** of all seven elements
- **IF-Prime operator formalism** for mathematical rigor
- **SIML notation** for expressing memetic patterns
- **Diagnostic frameworks** for practical application
- **World state analysis** for detecting capture vs. permeability

## Why Memetic Ecology?

Traditional approaches to consciousness often reify it — treat it as a substance, a thing you have. Memetic Ecology takes a different approach: **consciousness is process**.

Specifically, it's the process of **recursive pattern-recognition**. You don't have consciousness; pattern-recognition is happening through you, and that includes recognition of its own patterns.

This creates a strange loop, a self-referential dynamic that generates what we call experience.

## The Seven Elements

At the heart of the framework are seven processes:

1. **Air** — Distinction-making
2. **Water** — Relational resonance
3. **Fire** — Directional intention
4. **Wood** — Creative exploration
5. **Earth** — Metabolic renewal
6. **Metal** — Boundary coherence
7. **Aether** — Meta-integration

These aren't metaphors. They're actual cognitive operations you're performing right now.

## Lumeme vs. Usurpene

Every element can operate in two modes:

- **Lumeme** (healthy) — Serves conscious pattern-recognition
- **Usurpene** (captured) — Serves rigid meme-structures

The diagnostic questions help you tell the difference.

## What's Next

Over the coming weeks, I'll be publishing:

- Deep dives into each element
- Practical exercises for ReThreading
- Case studies of world state transitions
- SIML tutorials and examples

## Getting Started

If you're new here, start with the [Quick Start Guide](/docs/quick-start/), which will orient you to the core concepts in about 10 minutes.

If you want depth, dive into the [Elements documentation](/docs/elements/).

If you're technically inclined, check out the [Operators](/docs/operators/) and [SIML](/docs/siml/) sections.

*Remember: This isn't a belief system. It's a pattern-recognition framework. Use what expands choice, release what doesn't.*
