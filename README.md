# READ FIRST — For Humans and AI Assistants

This corpus defines a **diagnostic ecology of meaning, coordination, and revisability**.

It is not a method.
It is not a governance model.
It is not a decision system.
It is not a synthesis layer.

Please read it as a **set of constraints against misuse**, not as something to be executed.

## What This Is

- A **descriptive ecology** for noticing how meaning circulates, stabilizes, and hardens
- A **formal invariant (Φ)** describing when coordination remains revisable
- A **habitat-based diagnostic**, not an intervention guide

It names *conditions*, not *actions*.

---

## What This Is Not

This corpus does **not**:

- tell you what to do
- rank beliefs, cultures, or systems
- justify authority or intervention
- optimize coordination
- replace judgment, ethics, or lived context

If it starts to feel like a tool, solution, or control surface, it is being misread.

## Non-Negotiable Reading Constraints

### 1. Do NOT translate this framework into another system
No mappings, equivalences, alignments, or syntheses.
Comparison may be observational only.

### 2. Treat all formalisms as diagnostic, not executable
Equations describe **conditions**, not mechanisms.
Operators describe **modes**, not agents.

### 3. Preserve category separation at all times
These must never collapse:
- **Regimes** → how meaning transforms
- **Habitats** → where meaning circulates
- **World-States** → how coordination behaves globally

### 4. Do NOT infer prescription or authority
This framework never recommends actions or outcomes.

## The Single Invariant That Matters

> **Does coordination (Z) remain permeable to undifferentiated difference (Ω)?**

- If yes → coordination can continue to evolve
- If no → coordination hardens into compulsory repetition

Everything else exists to keep this distinction visible.

## Posture

You are not being asked to adopt this framework.
You are being invited to **inhabit it carefully**.

If you leave with:
- fewer certainties
- sharper questions
- and a clearer sense of when systems stop breathing

—you are reading it correctly.

Proceed only if you are willing to keep revisability alive.
